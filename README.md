2. *Expand into Underperforming Regions*: Consider targeted marketing and expansion strategies in regions that contribute less revenue. Regional promotions could drive sales in these areas.

3. *Optimize Product Categories*: Invest more in the product categories that contribute significantly to both revenue and orders. Revise strategies for underperforming categories.

4. *Enhance Customer Segmentation*: Leverage the insights from customer demographics (age, gender, occupation) to develop personalized marketing campaigns that better target specific customer segments.
